# YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer with Generative AI

**Introduction**

The YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer with GenAI is an innovative tool designed to save time by automatically generating concise summaries from YouTube video transcripts. This application leverages the YouTube Transcript API to retrieve video transcripts, and integrates Google's Gemini AI to summarize them, helping users get key takeaways quickly without watching the entire video. With a clean, user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, this project simplifies the process of obtaining summaries from video content, making it accessible to students, professionals, and anyone looking to boost their productivity.

**Features**

#### YouTube Video Transcript Retrieval:

   - **Input Video Link:** Users can easily provide a YouTube video link to the application. The system automatically extracts the video ID from the URL and prepares the request for the transcript.

   - **Transcript Language Detection:** Using the `YouTube Transcript API`, the application detects all available transcript languages for the given video. This ensures that users can choose their preferred language for summarization.

   - **Language Conversion:** The detected language codes are transformed into human-readable names using the `Langcodes` library, allowing users to effortlessly identify and select their preferred transcript language.


#### Transcript Processing:

   - **Language Selection:** Once the user selects their preferred transcript language, the YouTube Transcript API retrieves the transcript in that language. This step ensures that the transcript is tailored to the user‚Äôs language choice, preparing it for accurate AI processing.

   - **Transcript Handling:** The application then processes and formats the retrieved transcript to ensure it meets the requirements of the generative AI model. This step involves cleaning and organizing the text for effective summarization by the AI.


#### AI-Powered Summarization:

   - **Generative AI Model:** The project incorporates Google's Gemini AI `gemini-pro` model to generate summaries. The model processes the video transcript along with a carefully crafted prompt to deliver concise, accurate, and context-aware summaries, eliminating the need for users to watch the entire video.

   - **Custom Prompting:** The system uses an intelligently designed prompt that guides the AI in producing relevant summaries, ensuring the key points from the video are captured and presented clearly.


#### Streamlit Application:

   - **User-Friendly Interface:** The entire application is built using Streamlit, which provides a smooth and interactive interface. This ensures that users can easily input video links, select languages, and view the summarized content, all in one place.

   - **Real-Time Interaction:** The application provides real-time feedback and results, allowing users to receive their video summaries almost instantly. This makes the experience not only efficient but also highly responsive to user actions.
